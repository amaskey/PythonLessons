        "\n",
        "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\n",

        "**Modularity:** Objects help in building isolated modules or chunks of code. Each object is a self-contained unit. This modularity makes it easier to troubleshoot and maintain code, as changes to one object do not directly impact other parts of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation:** Objects encapsulate data and the methods that operate on that data. This means that the internal workings of an object can be hidden from the outside world. It's a way of restricting access to certain aspects of an object while exposing a controlled interface for interacting with it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reusability:** Objects can be reused across different parts of a program or even in different programs. This is achieved through inheritance, where a new class can inherit properties and methods from an existing class. Reusability saves time and effort as developers can use existing, tested, and debugged code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scalability:** Object-oriented programs are more scalable, making it easier to manage larger applications. As new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones, OOP is very useful for large, complex, and actively updated or maintained software.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Design Benefits:** Object-oriented design principles promote better organization of code and a clearer, more logical structure. This can lead to more efficient and effective problem-solving and development processes.\n"
